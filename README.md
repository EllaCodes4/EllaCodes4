- 👋 Hi, I’m @EllaCodes4!
- 🌱 I started learning to code with SheCodes during the pandemic and have since built a number of projects showcasing my skills (see below)! I am currently building a project with React so stay tuned!
- 👀 I’m interested in an Apprenticeship for Front End Developers in Edtech or an Entry-level position that provides mentorship.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will increase access and opportunities for underserved & underrepresented communities and projects that will revolutionize education & its systems. 
- 📫 Want to work together? Contact me at gcorales4@gmail.com
