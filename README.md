## Hi, I'm Gabriella! 

### A Stanford Grad, from San Antonio, TX, once Educator, now Front End Developer! 
I went to Stanford University as a First Generation college student and went on to passionately teach at schools serving underserved communities. I've always had a passion for elevating & educating others, and had always been interested in coding. During the pandemic, as the world changed, I decided to change with it. I started learning to code with SheCodes, an organization dedicated to teaching women how to code in order to close the gender gap in tech. I've always been in the business of breaking barriers, and I have no intention of stopping now. I'm passionate about making the world a better, more equitable place, and I'm joining the tech industry now with the same passion for elevating people & underserved communities using education and technology. Want to collaborate? Let's connect! ðŸ“« Contact me at: gcorales4@gmail.com
